## 1. Installing Miniconda, Git, and Cursor üêç

### Installing Cursor (Your AI-Powered Code Editor)

We're going to use Cursor - it's like having a smart coding assistant built right into your editor! Perfect for our vibe coding approach.

**Windows & Mac:**
1. Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Click "Download for Windows" or "Download for Mac"
3. Run the installer and follow the steps
4. Launch Cursor when installation is complete

**Why Cursor is perfect for this course:**
- **Built-in AI chat** - Ask questions about your code without leaving the editor
- **Smart suggestions** - AI helps you write code faster
- **Error explanations** - When something breaks, AI can explain what went wrong
- **Modern vibe** - This is how coding feels in 2025!

**Recommended Cursor Extensions:**
Once Cursor is open, click the Extensions icon (puzzle piece) on the left sidebar and install:
- **Python** (by Microsoft) - Helps with Python coding
- **Python Debugger** (by Microsoft) - Helps find and fix errors
- **Code Runner** - Lets you run code with a click

**Pro tip:** Try pressing `Ctrl+L` (or `Cmd+L` on Mac) to open the AI chat panel - you can ask it questions about your code anytime!

### Installing Miniconda (Python + Package Manager)

Instead of installing Python directly, we'll use Miniconda. This gives us Python AND helps us manage different projects cleanly (like having separate folders for different school subjects).

**Why Miniconda?**
- Avoids conflicts with any Python already on your computer
- Lets you create separate "environments" for different projects
- Makes installing packages much easier
- This is how professional developers work!

**Windows:**
1. Go to [docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Download "Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit"
3. Run the installer
4. When asked, check "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable"
5. Complete the installation

**Mac:**
1. Go to [docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Download "Miniconda3 macOS 64-bit pkg"
3. Run the installer and follow the steps

**Check if conda is installed:**
Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac) and type:
```bash
conda --version
```
You should see something like "conda 23.x.x" or similar.

### Installing Git

**Windows:**
1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. Download Git for Windows
3. Run the installer (you can use all default settings)

**Mac:**
Git might already be installed! Try typing `git --version` in Terminal. If not:
1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. Download Git for macOS
3. Run the installer

**Check if Git is installed:**
### Creating Your First Python Environment

Now let's create a special space for your AI project. Think of this like creating a dedicated folder for a school project - it keeps everything organized and separate.

**Create a new environment:**
```bash
conda create -n gemini-project python=3.11
```

**Activate your environment:**
```bash
conda activate gemini-project
```

Your terminal prompt should now show `(gemini-project)` at the beginning - this means you're in your special Python environment!

**Important:** You'll need to activate this environment every time you work on this project. It's like opening the right folder for your homework.

**To deactivate later (when you're done coding):**
```bash
conda deactivate
```

## 2. Python Basics üéØ

Let's learn some fundamental Python concepts with examples you can try!

### Variables
Variables are like containers that store data:

```python
# String (text)
name = "Alex"
favorite_color = "blue"

# Numbers
age = 16
height = 5.8

# Boolean (True/False)
is_student = True

print(f"Hi, I'm {name}! I'm {age} years old.")
```

### Strings
Strings are text data. Here are some cool things you can do:

```python
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message.upper())  # HELLO, WORLD!
print(message.lower())  # hello, world!
print(len(message))     # 13 (length of the string)

# String formatting
name = "Sarah"
age = 17
intro = f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old."
print(intro)
```

### Loops
Loops let you repeat code multiple times:

```python
# For loop - repeat a specific number of times
for i in range(5):
    print(f"This is loop number {i}")

# For loop with a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# While loop - repeat while a condition is true
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1
```

### Fun Challenge: Drawing Shapes with Code! üé®

Let's use loops to create cool patterns. This is where coding gets creative!

**Square Pattern:**
```python
# Draw a 5x5 square
size = 5
for i in range(size):
    print("* " * size)
```

**Triangle Pattern:**
```python
# Draw a triangle
height = 5
for i in range(1, height + 1):
    print("* " * i)
```

**Diamond Pattern (Challenge!):**
```python
# Draw a diamond - this one's tricky!
size = 5

# Top half (including middle)
for i in range(1, size + 1):
    spaces = " " * (size - i)
    stars = "* " * i
    print(spaces + stars)

# Bottom half
for i in range(size - 1, 0, -1):
    spaces = " " * (size - i)
    stars = "* " * i
    print(spaces + stars)
```

**Your Turn - Shape Challenges:**
Try creating these shapes (use Cursor's AI if you get stuck!):

1. **Right Triangle:** A triangle that leans to the right
2. **Hollow Square:** A square that's empty in the middle
3. **Christmas Tree:** A triangle with a trunk at the bottom
4. **Heart Shape:** Get creative with this one!

**Cursor AI Tip:** If you want to try these challenges, ask Cursor's AI: "Can you help me draw a [shape name] using Python loops and print statements?"

### Try it yourself!
Create a file called `python_practice.py` and experiment with these concepts!

**How to create and run a Python file in Cursor:**
1. Open Cursor
2. Click "File" ‚Üí "New File"
3. Save it as `python_practice.py` (the .py extension tells Cursor it's Python)
4. Write some Python code
5. Right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal"
6. Or use the play button in the top-right corner if you installed Code Runner

**Cursor AI tip:** If you get stuck, press `Ctrl+L` (or `Cmd+L` on Mac) and ask the AI: "Can you explain what this code does?" or "Why am I getting an error?"

## 3. Gemini SDK Setup ü§ñ

Now let's set up Google's Gemini AI so you can build AI-powered apps!

### Step 1: Get your API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key and save it somewhere safe!

### Step 2: Install the Gemini SDK
Make sure your gemini-project environment is activated first:
```bash
conda activate gemini-project
```

Then install the Gemini SDK:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

### Step 3: Set up your environment
Create a new file called `.env` in your project folder:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

**Important:** Never share your API key publicly or commit it to GitHub!

---

## 4. Hello World with Gemini üåü

Let's create your first AI-powered program!

Create a file called `gemini_hello.py`:

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import os

# Configure the API key
# For now, we'll put the key directly in the code
# (In real projects, use environment variables)
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual key
genai.configure(api_key=api_key)

# Create a model instance
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

# Simple chat completion
def chat_with_gemini(prompt):
    try:
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

# Test it out!
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("ü§ñ Welcome to Gemini Chat!")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        
        response = chat_with_gemini(user_input)
        print(f"Gemini: {response}\n")
```

### How to run it:
1. Make sure your environment is activated:
```bash
conda activate gemini-project
```
2. Open Cursor
3. Create a new file and save it as `gemini_hello.py`
4. Copy and paste the code above
5. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
6. Right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal"
7. Start chatting with AI!

**Cursor AI tip:** If you run into any issues, press `Ctrl+L` (or `Cmd+L` on Mac) and ask the AI: "I'm getting an error with my Gemini API setup, can you help me debug this?"

### What's happening in the code:
- We import the Gemini library
- We configure it with our API key
- We create a model instance
- We make a function that sends prompts to Gemini and gets responses
- We create a simple chat loop
