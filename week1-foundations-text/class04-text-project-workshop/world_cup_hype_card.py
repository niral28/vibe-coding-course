"""
GSET Vibe Coding — Class 4 Project: World Cup Hype Card ⚽🔥
============================================================

What this program does:
  1. You pick the two finalist teams (below).
  2. Gemini writes a fun hype paragraph + fun facts + a score prediction.
  3. Gemini's "Nano Banana" image model draws a match poster (saved as poster.png).

------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU NEED (requirements)
------------------------------------------------------------
  • The course libraries. If you followed the README setup, you already have them.
    If not, from the project's main folder run:

        conda activate gset-vibes
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    (This program uses two of those libraries: `google-genai` and `pillow`.)

  • Your Gemini API key saved in the `.env` file (see README Step 5). This program
    reads it automatically — you don't paste your key into the code. 🎉

------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN IT
------------------------------------------------------------
  From the project's main folder, with your `gset-vibes` environment active:

      python week1-foundations-text/class04-text-project-workshop/world_cup_hype_card.py

  The poster is saved as `poster.png` in whatever folder you ran the command from.

# --- Libraries we use -------------------------------------------------------

from io import BytesIO             # turns raw image bytes into something Pillow can open
