GSET Vibe Coding — Class 5 Starter: AI Wordle Game Master 🟩🟨⬜
================================================================


WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING
 An AI that runs a game of Wordle *for you* in the terminal. You type 5-letter
 guesses; the AI uses TOOLS (functions you give it) to check each guess and it
 keeps the game going in a LOOP until you win or run out of guesses.


 Once this works in the terminal, you'll hand it to Antigravity and say
 "turn this into a web app" — see the README. Get the brain working first! 🧠


TWO BIG IDEAS (this is the whole point of Class 5)
 • FUNCTION CALLING  -> we hand the AI some Python functions ("tools") it can run.
 • AGENTIC LOOP      -> a while-loop that lets the AI keep taking steps on its own.


HOW TO RUN IT
 1. Make sure your key is set:  copy .env.example to .env and paste your key in.
 2. From the project's ROOT folder, with (gset-vibes) active:


      python week1-foundations-text/class05-function-calling-agents/wordle_agent_starter.py


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR STEP-BY-STEP CHECKLIST  (search the file for "TODO" to find each one)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TODO 1 — Write the system prompt (tell the AI its job + the secret word).
 TODO 2 — Finish the description of the validate_word tool.
 TODO 3 — Ask the AI what to do (make the model call inside the loop).
 TODO 4 — When the AI calls validate_word, run it and hand back the result.
 TODO 5 — Stop the loop when the game is over.


 💡 Everything you DON'T need to change is already written for you below and
    labeled "BUILDING BLOCK". Read the comments — they explain what each part does.
