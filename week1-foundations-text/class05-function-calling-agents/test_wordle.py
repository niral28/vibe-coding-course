"""
Self-check for the Wordle building blocks 🟩
============================================

Run this to make sure the game logic works. It does NOT need your API key and does
NOT talk to the AI — it just checks the plain Python function `validate_word`.

HOW TO RUN (from the project's ROOT folder, with (gset-vibes) active):

    python week1-foundations-text/class05-function-calling-agents/test_wordle.py

You should see a row of ✅ PASS lines. If you see a ❌ FAIL, read the message —
it tells you what was expected.
