"""
Self-check for the Weather building blocks ⛅
=============================================

Run this to make sure the two weather tools work. It does NOT need your API key
(Open-Meteo is free!), but it DOES use the internet, so make sure you're online.

HOW TO RUN (from the project's ROOT folder, with (gset-vibes) active):

    python week1-foundations-text/class05-function-calling-agents/test_weather.py

You should see ✅ PASS lines. If a check fails because you're offline, connect to
the internet and try again.
