GSET Vibe Coding — Class 5 Starter: Wikipedia Research Agent 📚🔎
================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING
  Ask a factual question and the AI answers it by *looking it up on Wikipedia*
  instead of guessing from memory. It searches, reads the article, and then
  answers WITH A SOURCE LINK — in a LOOP, until it has a grounded answer.

  This is called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): the AI "retrieves" real
  facts first, then writes its answer using them. RAG is one of the best ways to
  STOP an AI from "hallucinating" (making things up). See the README for more.

  Once this works in the terminal, hand it to Antigravity to make a web app.

TWO+ONE BIG IDEAS
  • FUNCTION CALLING  -> the AI can run our search_wikipedia() tool.
  • AGENTIC LOOP      -> it can search again and again until it can answer.
  • RAG (grounding)   -> it answers ONLY from what it looked up, and cites the source.

HOW TO RUN IT
  1. Copy .env.example to .env and paste your Gemini key in.
  2. From the project's ROOT folder, with (gset-vibes) active (needs internet):

       python week1-foundations-text/class05-function-calling-agents/research_agent_starter.py

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR STEP-BY-STEP CHECKLIST  (search the file for "TODO")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TODO 1 — Write the system prompt (this is where you tell the AI to use ONLY the
           Wikipedia results and to CITE the source — the anti-hallucination rule!).
  TODO 2 — Finish the description of the give_answer tool.
  TODO 3 — Ask the AI what to do (make the model call inside the loop).
  TODO 4 — When the AI calls give_answer, print the answer and its source.
  TODO 5 — Stop the loop once the AI has answered.
