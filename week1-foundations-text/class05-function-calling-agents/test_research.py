"""
Self-check for the Research (RAG) building block 📚
===================================================

Run this to make sure the Wikipedia search tool works. It does NOT need your API
key, but it DOES use the internet, so make sure you're online.

HOW TO RUN (from the project's ROOT folder, with (gset-vibes) active):

    python week1-foundations-text/class05-function-calling-agents/test_research.py

You should see ✅ PASS lines. If a check fails because you're offline, connect to
the internet and try again.
