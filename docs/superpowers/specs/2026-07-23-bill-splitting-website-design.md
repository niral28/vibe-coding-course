# Bill-Splitting Agent Website — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Location:** `week1-foundations-text/class05-function-calling-agents/`

## Goal

Turn the working terminal program `bill_splitting_agent.py` into a clean web page
that keeps the same tools and agentic loop, visually announces every Gemini API
call and loop step, adds country-aware tax/tipping via Gemini's own knowledge,
and explains the code simply to students.

## Architecture

- **New file `bill_splitting_web.py`** — a Flask app in the class05 folder.
- **New file `static/index.html`** — the entire frontend (one self-contained
  page: HTML + CSS + vanilla JS, no build step).
- **`bill_splitting_agent.py` keeps working unchanged as a terminal program.**
  The web app imports `add_expense`, `calculate_split`, `tools`, and `client`
  from it so there is one source of truth for the tools.
- **Flow:** browser POSTs the chat message → Flask runs the same agentic loop
  (max 6 steps per turn) → each step is **streamed live to the browser via
  server-sent events (SSE)**: `api_call`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`,
  `final_answer`, `error` events. The console shows real round-trips as they
  happen, not a replay.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` stays in `.env` on the server; the browser never sees it.
- Single-user, in-memory session state (the `expenses` list), matching the
  terminal version. A "Reset tab" button clears expenses and the conversation.

## Tool changes (same tools, one small extension)

- `add_expense(description, amount)` — untouched.
- `calculate_split(num_people, tip_percent=0, tax_percent=0)` — gains an
  optional `tax_percent`; the returned JSON adds `tax_amount` and includes tax
  in `total`. Tool schema updated to match.
- **System prompt extension:** if the user mentions a country, Gemini uses its
  own knowledge of that country's sales tax/VAT and tipping culture — it passes
  the tax rate and a culturally appropriate tip to `calculate_split` and
  briefly explains the custom (e.g. "In Japan tipping isn't customary, so I
  used 0%"). No new tool and no hardcoded country table: this is where the API
  is "put to use".
- Terminal version's prompt/tool schema updated identically so both stay in sync.

## The page

- **Header:** app name + one-line explanation.
- **Left — chat panel:** user/AI bubbles; small inline tool-call chips
  mirroring the terminal's `🔧 AI is using tool` lines; a running-tab card
  listing current expenses and the total; hint chip under the input:
  *"💡 Tip: mention a country — 'we're in Japan' — and I'll apply local tax &
  tipping customs."*
- **Right — Agent Console (star feature):** live numbered timeline per turn:
  `📤 Calling Gemini API (request #1)` (pulsing badge with model name) →
  `🔧 Tool call: add_expense({...})` → `📥 Tool result` →
  `📤 Calling Gemini API (request #2)` → `💬 Final answer`. Numbered requests
  make the loop visible: one user message, several API round-trips.
- **Bottom — "How it works":** three short cards explaining the code simply:
  ① Function calling (the AI doesn't do math — it asks Python to),
  ② The agentic loop (keep calling Gemini until it stops asking for tools),
  ③ The tools themselves, showing the actual tool definitions.
- Clean, modern, single screen; responsive enough for a projector demo.

## Error handling

- Missing/invalid `GEMINI_API_KEY` → friendly banner on the page, no crash.
- Gemini/network errors → red `error` step in the Agent Console.
- Unknown tool name → error JSON returned to the model (as in the terminal
  version).

## Testing

- Extend `test_bill_splitting.py` with `tax_percent` math checks — still pure
  math, no API key needed.
- End-to-end: run the Flask app, exercise in the browser (add expenses,
  mention a country, split, reset).
- Add `flask` to the root `requirements.txt`.

## Out of scope

- Multi-user sessions, persistence, auth, deployment — this is a local class
  demo run with `python bill_splitting_web.py`.
